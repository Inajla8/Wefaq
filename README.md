The project idea is based on the whole concept of simplifying and solving the problems that come along the process of forming groups of students to work on projects.   A student can use this application to look for suitable team members for projects whether for academic courses or competitions. 

The main goal of this project is to shorten the time taken by the students in the process of forming groups and enable them to choose efficiently and accurately suitable team members to facilitate doing different projects in the shortest time possible.
